# Birthday info
A Python 3 module designed for such tasks, for example, as: to remind about an upcoming birthday, to find out how old a person is, to find out his zodiac sign, and so on.
All its classes can be used as independent components, or they can be used all at once, including reading from a predefined format file.brt (a text file, the extension is just for beauty, it can be any or without it).
